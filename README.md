
## BIONIT: Biological Network Integration using Relation-Aware Transformer
BIONIT is a deep-learning based biological network integration framework, built on top of the recent [BIONIC](https://github.com/bowang-lab/BIONIC/tree/master/bionic) framework, with two novel modifications: First, we propose two mechanisms for encoding edge weights as part of network integration. Second, we replace the GAT layers with a transformer network, which allows proteins to attend to all other proteins in the network.

We thank the authors of BIONIC, especially Duncan Forster, for sharing their code and data.
